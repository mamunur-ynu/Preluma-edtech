# Autopilot milestone report

Updated: 2026-10-13, Asia/Shanghai. Branch `feature/preluma-release-hardening`, draft PR #2. Exact current commit SHA is available from `git rev-parse HEAD`; the preceding SEC-01 commit is `1554f3d`.

## Completed in this milestone

- SEC-01: unlabeled RAG uploads fail closed; curated topics are explicitly public; document indexing requires active staff and scopes duplicate bytes by owner, course and visibility.
- SEC-02: every login has a server session, every Streamlit rerun revalidates it, open tabs lose access after deactivation/password change, and role changes refresh. Active-account and enrollment checks protect affected AI/course/learning/recommendation services.
- SEC-04: teacher analytics and student drill-down require active teacher/admin actors; teachers see only owned or shared-course rosters, and mistake counts no longer include other teachers' students. Course selectors reflect that same authorization.
- The repository now has durable `AGENTS.md` and the planning queue, worklog, current-state checkpoint, release gates and decision log specified by the owner.

## Verification actually executed

| Check | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Full Pytest | 126 passed in 5.03 s (latest SEC-04 run) |
| SEC-04 + Streamlit runtime focused tests | 13 passed in 4.68 s |
| Role and login Streamlit AppTests | 10 passed in 4.23 s |
| Ruff | PASS |
| Python compileall | PASS |
| Bandit (B311 demo randomness excluded) | PASS |
| pip-audit for runtime and dev requirements | No known vulnerabilities found |
| Campus/tower SHA-256 | Both match the required values in `AGENTS.md` |

These tests use synthetic SQLite data and offline/mocked AI. Python 3.10, real PostgreSQL, RLS/private object storage, live paid providers, secure gateway and staging/production were NOT RUN. Current release status remains `DEMO_READY`, with production/pilot blockers listed in `planning/RELEASE_GATES.md`.

Course views are roster-scoped but cannot isolate the learning activity of students enrolled in multiple courses: quiz attempts/mastery do not store a course ID. This is tracked as DATA-03. Teacher analytics should not be represented as precise per-course activity until that work is complete.

No merge to `main`, deployment, production data mutation or paid API call was performed.
